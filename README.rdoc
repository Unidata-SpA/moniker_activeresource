=== Keystone authentication and Moniker setup

    OpenStack::Keystone::Public::Base.site = "https://my.api.com:5000/v2.0/"

    auth = OpenStack::Keystone::Public::Auth.new :username  => "me",
                                                 :password  => "my pass",
                                                 :tenant_id => "my_tenant"

    if auth.save
      Moniker::Base.token = auth.token
      Moniker::Base.site  = auth.endpoint_for('dns').publicURL
      # *** Set the sudo tenant id (if needed!)
      Moniker::Base.sudo_tenant = "another tenant id"
    else
      raise "Cannot authenticate!"
    end

=== Create a new server (requires an administrative role)

    new_server = Moniker::Server.create :name => "test.test-server.test."

=== List existing server (requires an administrative role)

    servers = Moniker::Server.all

=== Get a server (requires an administrative role)

    # By name
    server = Moniker::Server.find_by_name "test.test-server.test."
    # By id
    Moniker::Server.find "ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff"

=== Update a server  (requires an administrative role)

    server = Moniker::Server.find_by_name "test.test-server.test."
    server.update_attributes :name => "up-test.test-server.test."
    server.save
    # Done! Now revert
    server.name = "test.test-server.test."
    server.save

=== Destroy a server (requires an administrative role)

    server = Moniker::Server.find_by_name "test.test-server.test."
    server.destroy

=== Create a new domain (depending on your configuration, this might require an administrative role)

    new_domain = Moniker::Domain.create :name => "test.test-domain.test.", :email => "fake@pretend.net"

=== List existing domains

    domains = Moniker::Domain.all

=== Get a domain

    # By name
    domain = Moniker::Domain.find_by_name "test.test-domain.test."
    # By id
    Moniker::Domain.find "ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff"

=== Update a domain (depending on your configuration, this might require an administrative role)

    domain = Moniker::Domain.find_by_name n"test.test-domain.test."ame
    domain.update_attributes :ttl => 225
    domain.save
    # Again but now without update_attributes
    domain.ttl = 128
    domain.save

=== Destroy a domain (depending on your configuration, this might require an administrative role)

    domain = Moniker::Domain.find_by_name n"test.test-domain.test."ame
    domain.destroy

=== Create a new record

    domain = Moniker::Domain.find_by_name "test.test-domain.test."
    new_record = Moniker::Record.create :name => record_name,
                                        :type => "A",
                                        :data => "1.1.1.1",
                                        :domain_id => domain.id

=== List existing records in a domain

    domain = Moniker::Domain.find_by_name "test.test-domain.test."
    records = Moniker::Record.all :params => {:domain_id => domain.id}

=== Get a record in a domain

    domain = Moniker::Domain.find_by_name "test.test-domain.test."
    # All by name
    records = Moniker::Record.find_all_by_name record_name, :params => {:domain_id => domain.id}
    # All by type
    records = Moniker::Record.find_all_by_type "AAAA", :params => {:domain_id => domain.id}
    # All by data
    records = Moniker::Record.find_all_by_data "1.1.1.1", :params => {:domain_id => domain.id}
    # By id
    record = Moniker::Record.find "ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff", :params => {:domain_id => domain.id}

=== Update a record in a domain

    record = Moniker::Record.find "ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff", :params => {:domain_id => domain.id}
    record.update_attributes :ttl => 225
    record.save
    # Again but now without update_attributes
    record.ttl = 128
    record.save

== Contributing to moniker_activeresource
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
